These Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data sets can be enormous, with detailed information on temperature, humidity, sun, wind, etc. for a given location. We'll just look at a small excerpt. \n",

It was provided by Prof. Steve Harrison of the Queen's Solar Calorimetry Lab housed in Mechanical and Materials Engineering. It seems reasonable to expect Toronto data to be similar to the situation in Kingston. To make sense of it, we should probably compare it to clear sky expectations for the same period of time. It's important to note that November is a gloomy month generally (averaging $2.41\\rm\\;kWh/m^2$ from the NRCan data) and this historical period looks especially gloomy.\n",
